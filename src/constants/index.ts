          overviewDetail: `The Leading SAFe certification has become a standard requirement for Lean-Agile enterprises. It expands your horizons in terms of potential career paths and value within the sector. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is the most widely adopted enterprise Agile approach according to most survey data, with 53% using it, according to the 16th Annual State of Agile Report.

While Agile approaches have proven to be easily applicable to small teams, the majority of enterprises today work across collaborative teams, complex systems, and geographies. This requires Agile to work across your enterprise to bring in the benefits of faster delivery, better-quality products, and quick response to your customer queries. However, large-scale agile transformation is prone to failure due to a lack of suitable structure and processes, resulting in agile implementations that do not have the desired impact.

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a comprehensive framework for large-scale Agile project teams to easily implement an Agile transformation. The first step toward such a change is to use Lean/Agile principles and practices at all levels of your organization. The SAFe methodology synchronizes the alignment, collaboration, and delivery of numerous Agile teams with ease, paving the road for organizational success. Now, in its latest release (version 6.0), SAFe promises to bring in full business agility with significant advances in strategy, execution, and leadership competencies that will help individuals and enterprises deliver innovative business solutions and outperform the competition in its latest release (version 6.0).`,

Widely adopted by top organizations across the globe, Agile is a methodology that has proven to be highly effective in transforming businesses, catalyzing innovation, and accelerating profitable growth.

Scrum stands out as the most dominant Agile framework with a 58% adoption rate across organizations globally. It challenges the notion of the top-down approach to project management and focuses on a software development life cycle based on an incremental and iterative approach. Products are built in short sprints and the focus is on maximizing performance and quality.`,
